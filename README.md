# DOL-PD
A repository for the DOL-PD project, implementing USB-C PD support for the Gamecube!
<!--- Once you have a logo for the project, put it here! <p align="center"><img src="image source in repo" width="600"/></p> -->

<p align="justify">DOL-PD is a power switch board replacement for the Gamecube. Bulky Gamecube power brick taking up media center space? Need a less cluttered solution for your tournament setups? Or do you just not have access to an old Gamecube power brick anymore? Just swap out your power board with the DOL-PD and enjoy the convenience of running your Gamecube with USB-C off of a readily available USB-PD wall charger! The project is completely open source. Make it, sell it, improve it, whatever you can think of! Bringing your Gamecube into the modern age has never been easier with this board.</p>

## PARTS LIST
* [Parts List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rPVbGJX8rQoN7rI187_ITezFnfsLrNyPKBN4Mu2_UrU/edit?usp=sharing)

*Be sure to use the list of parts under the V1 sheet! V2 is still in development and does not have finalized components*

*Note: V1 currently utilizes HDR's 3D printed enclosure for the USB-C port. This enclosure is free to use under the CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 License, and therefore is free to use and redistribute, however is NOT USABLE FOR SALE. If you plan to use the DOL-PD to produce your own boards for sale, you must create your own USB-C shroud. In the future, I may release a modified V1 board that uses an alternative USB-C port with a 3D printed enclosure of my own design that will be free use.*

*An in depth board assembly instructional video is coming soon! In the meantime, a rudimentary google doc will be provided in its place.*

## THE FUTURE OF DOL-PD
As of 9/3/2023, DOL-PD V1 has been completed and released publicly. Going forward, there are 3 main goals for the DOL-PD project:
* Create DOL-PD V2, utilizing an integrated buck converter to allow the Gamecube to take in 15V and step down to 12V. This should greatly increase compatibility with USB-PD chargers. V2 is also planned to utilize a different USB-C port from V1 to allow for a complete no-cut solution. I may also re-release V1 with this alternate USB-C port.
* Create DOL-PD Rev-B, giving users the option to transfer their original Gamecube power button to maintain original power button feel and functionality.
* Create DOL-PD EXT, an external version of DOL-PD that will not require any internal modification of the Gamecube. This will however require custom sourced Gamecube Male power port molds.
