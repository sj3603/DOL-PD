## THE FUTURE OF DOL-PD
As of 8/26/2023, DOL-PD V1 has been completed and released publicly. Going forward, there are 3 main goals for the DOL-PD project:
* Create DOL-PD V2, utilizing an integrated buck converter to allow the Gamecube to take in 15V and step down to 12V. This should greatly increase compatibility with USB-PD chargers. V2 is also planned to utilize a different USB-C port from V1 to allow for a complete no-cut solution.
* Create DOL-PD Rev-B, giving users the option to transfer their original Gamecube power button to maintain original power button feel and functionality.
* Create DOL-PD EXT, an external version of DOL-PD that will not require any internal modification of the Gamecube. This will however require custom sourced Gamecube Male power ports.
